										<h1>Embedded Systems - PICF877A Development Board.</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>Project Overview and Inspiration.</h2>
									<p>
										For my module for Embedded Systems at the University, we were tasked with creating a GreenHouse Control System using a PIC QL200 Development Board.
									</p>
									<h2>System Overview/Features.</h2>
									<p>
										The System contains a time of day clock and have features such as:
										<ul>
											<li>Setting up date/time.
											</li>
											<li>Display of current temperature.</li>
											<li>Display current date/time/month.</li>
											<li>Entry of trigger temperaures.</li>
											<li>Two output controls; one for a heating circuit and one for air circulation.</li>
										  </ul> 

										  When the temperature drops below a set threshold, the heating output will be turned on. If the temperature continues to drop an alarm signal is produced. The user is able to
										  clear the alarm signal by pressing the assigned clear button on the Development board.
										  When the temperature rises below a set threshold, a cooling output will be turned on. If the temperatures continues to rise an alarm signal is produced. The user is able to reset
										  the alarm by pressing the designated button on the development board.
									</p>
									<h3>Date/Time Setup and Display.</h3>
									<p>
										Setting up of the date/time display was managed using the lcd12864 LCD panel and programmed while playing close attention to the lcd12864 datasheet. Setting up
										commands such as cursor placement, clear screen, circuitry setup and read/write timings using timing diagrams were managed while strictly following the datasheet.
									</p>
									<h3>Current Temperature Management.</h3>
									<p>
										Temperature sensing hardware was the DS18B20 Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer by Dallas Semiconductor. Temperatur/Data Relationships were managed using the associated
										Datasheet showing Temperature(in Celcius) conversion to Binary output(Digital Output) and Hexadecimal equivalent. Initialization and ROM search was managed by strictly following the DS18B20 Thermometer
										 Datasheet.
									</p>
									<h3>Timekeeping Chip.</h3>
									<p>
										Date/Time management was managed by the DS1302 Trickle Charge Timekeeping chip which enabled:
										<ul>
											<li>Real-time clock counts seconds, minutes, hours.
											</li>
											<li>Date of month, day of month/week and month.</li>
											<li>Leap year compenstation up to the year 2100.</li>
										  </ul> 
										Data input and output operations were programmed following the PIC's SCLK cycles and following the hardware Datasheet.
									</p>
