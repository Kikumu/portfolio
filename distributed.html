										<h1>Distributed Systems Project.</h1>
									</header>
					
									<h2>Project overview and inspiration.</h2>
									<p>This project is part of the distributed systems coursework. Using elements of C#, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Web API and Cryptography, a distributed systems program was created.The program consisted of server-client communication and task distribution while ensuring information sent between the server and client is safely encrypted during transmission </p>
									<h2>Features.</h2>
									<h3>User Creation.</h3>
									<p>There were 2 types of users which were usable with the server and client. These were the Admin and User user types. Requests were sent to the server using GET and POST requests to check if any user was either in the database or the username was already taken. The first user to log on to the server will be automatically assigned an Admin user-type. Other user log ons after this will be automatically assigned a "User" user-type. This can be demonstrated in the video below.</p>
