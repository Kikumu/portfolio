										<h1>PathFinding using Dijkstras algorithm.</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>Project Overview and Inspiration.</h2>
									<p>
										For my module for Advanced Programming at the University, I was tasked with creating a Path Finding algorithm with the C++ code base. Algorithm of choice
										was up to the student however, the program should be as fast and as efficient as possible. Unit tests were run prior to launching the program using Parasoft.
									</p>

									<h3>Software Design.</h3>
									<p>
										Initial starting code was provided and was mandatory to be utilized at the beginning of the program. Dynamic data structures were then implemented to store dynamic data such as nodes(places)
										and arcs(pathways). Commands were executed through a text file containing places. The software will then determine if the places are available, which mode of transport is possible
										and the distance between the 2(or more) places. There were several rules which were applied when moving through arcs which are:
										<ul>
											<li>A rail or ship journey may only use arcs(paths) of the corresponding mode.
											</li>
											<li>A bus journey may use bus and ship arcs, while a car journey may use car, bus and ship arcs.</li>
											<li>a bike journey may use bike arcs and the 2 previously mentioned arcs.</li>
											<li>A foot journey can use any arc.</li>
											
										  </ul> </p>
									</p>

									<h3>Tools Used.</h3>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>C++ code base.
											</li>
											<li>Parasoft. (Wonderful profiling software helps improve code efficiency).</li>
		
											
										  </ul>
